RPG ([rpg.hackclub.com](https://rpg.hackclub.com)) is a gamified YSWS where you defeat bosses and earn treasure by spending time on personal projects. 

Earn a physical trading card + stickers of the bosses you helped defeat, plus bonus loot ðŸ‘€ for all adventurers.

## Development

5. With the values of `DATABASE_URL`, `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` and `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` obtained from steps 3 and 4, fill out the `.env` file. Set the `AUTH_URL` to the Redirect URL used in configuring Step 4.
